    <h1 id="t_color" class="t_color "><u>Burger</u></h1>
    <p  class="line_height t_transfrom_capitalize t_decor_under">The modern hamburger's history is debated but generally points to the late 1800s in the US, with multiple claims
        like Charlie Nagreen in Wisconsin, the Menches Brothers at the Erie County Fair, or Louis Lassen at Louis' Lunch
        in Connecticut, all in the 1885-1900 timeframe. </p>

    <h1 id="t_color" class="t_color "><u>Cadbee</u></h1>
    <p class="line_height t_transfrom_capitalize t_decor_under"> Cadbee or more commonly referred to in its full name CAD (M) CAD (B), is not a traditional company with a
        corporate history, but rather a popular type of thick chocolate shake that originated in Pune, India</p>

    <h1 id="t_color" class="t_color "><u>Hot coffee</u></h1>
    <p class="line_height t_transfrom_capitalize t_decor_under" >The history of hot coffee began with its discovery in Ethiopia, likely by a goat herder named Kaldi around 850
        AD, who noticed his goats became energetic after eating the red berries of a coffee bush. From Ethiopia, coffee
        spread to Yemen, where it was first cultivated and brewed as a beverage in the 15th century. The world's first
        coffee house opened in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in 1475, and coffee quickly spread across the Middle
        East and into Europe, becoming a popular and profitable commodity. </p>

    <h1 id="t_color" class="t_color "><u>mirch-masala-pizza</u></h1>
    <p class="line_height t_transfrom_capitalize t_decor_under" >The term "Mirch Masala Pizza" likely refers to the Mirch Masala restaurant chain, not a type of pizza. This
        restaurant concept, which opened its first location in Ahmedabad in 1992, was founded by Rushad Ginwala and is
        inspired by the rustic ambiance of Punjabi roadside "dhaba" restaurants, complete with iconic decor</p>

    <h1 id="t_color" class="t_color "><u>sizzling-brownie</u></h1>
    <p class="line_height t_transfrom_capitalize t_decor_under">The sizzling brownie originated in India, likely created by restaurants in Mumbai to popularize the dessert. It
        became a hit in the late 20th century, with chains like Cream Centre credited for popularizing it nationwide</p>
    <img src="img/sizzling-brownie.webp" alt="sizzling-brownie" class="b_prop" />

    <h1 id="t_color" class="t_color "><u>veg-club-grill</u></h1>
    <p class="line_height t_transfrom_capitalize t_decor_under">"Veg Club Grill" is a general descriptive term for restaurants that offer vegetarian food, especially grilled
        items and club sandwiches, rather than a single, specific restaurant chain with a unified history. Therefore,
        there is no single, specific history for a company named "Veg Club Grill". </p>
