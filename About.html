    <h1></mark></h1>
    <p>"Veg Club Grill" is a general descriptive term for restaurants that offer vegetarian food, especially grilled
        items and club sandwiches, rather than a single, specific restaurant chain with a unified history. Therefore,
        there is no single, specific history for a company named "Veg Club Grill". </p>

    <h1>sizzling-brownie</h1>
    <p>The sizzling brownie originated in India, likely created by restaurants in Mumbai to popularize the dessert. It
        became a hit in the late 20th century, with chains like Cream Centre credited for popularizing it nationwide</p>

    <h1>mirch-masala-pizza</h1>
    <p>The term "Mirch Masala Pizza" likely refers to the Mirch Masala restaurant chain, not a type of pizza. This
        restaurant concept, which opened its first location in Ahmedabad in 1992, was founded by Rushad Ginwala and is
        inspired by the rustic ambiance of Punjabi roadside "dhaba" restaurants, complete with iconic decor</p>

    <h1>Burger</h1>
    <p>The modern hamburger's history is debated but generally points to the late 1800s in the US, with multiple claims
        like Charlie Nagreen in Wisconsin, the Menches Brothers at the Erie County Fair, or Louis Lassen at Louis' Lunch
        in Connecticut, all in the 1885-1900 timeframe. </p>

    <h1>Cadbee</h1>
    <p>Cadbee, or more commonly referred to in its full name CAD (M) CAD (B), is not a traditional company with a
        corporate history, but rather a popular type of thick chocolate shake that originated in Pune, India. </p>
